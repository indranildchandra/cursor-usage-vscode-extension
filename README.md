# Cursor Usage

> Track your remaining Cursor fast-premium requests and usage-based spending directly in your Cursor's status bar with intelligent reset tracking and usage analytics.

## What It Gives You

This extension displays your remaining Cursor fast-premium requests count in Cursor's status bar, with usage-based spending information shown when you've exhausted your included requests. It includes intelligent reset date tracking, daily usage analytics, and robust fault tolerance features. Think of it as your personal AI usage speedometer with financial tracking, predictive insights, and reliable data fetching.

**Core Features:**

- **Real-time tracking**: See your remaining requests at a glance (e.g., `‚ö° 247`)
- **Smart reset tracking**: Know exactly when your quota resets and how many days remain
- **Usage analytics**: Daily usage rate tracking and quota exhaustion predictions
- **Smart transitions**: When requests are exhausted, seamlessly shows spending vs limit (e.g., `$1.52/$150.00`)
- **Smart color coding**: Visual warnings when you're running low on requests or approaching spend limits

**Fault Tolerance & Reliability:**

- **Retry mechanisms**: Automatically retries failed API calls up to 3 times with smart delays
- **Intelligent caching**: Caches stable API responses (user info, teams) for 24 hours to reduce API load
- **Cache invalidation**: Automatically clears stale cache when authentication changes
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues working with cached data when APIs are unavailable
- **Network resilience**: Handles various network errors with user-friendly messages

**Enhanced User Experience:**

- **Status bar timestamps**: Shows "Last updated at: [timestamp], Click to refresh"
- **Enhanced tooltips**: Comprehensive breakdown with reset dates, usage patterns, and predictive warnings
- **Click to refresh**: Quick manual refresh by clicking the status bar
- **Automatic updates**: Configurable polling to keep data fresh
- **Command Palette Access**: All key actions are available via commands

## How It Works

The extension authenticates with Cursor's API using your browser session cookie and implements a robust, fault-tolerant architecture:

**Data Fetching Strategy:**

- **Retry Logic**: Failed API calls are automatically retried up to 3 times with progressive delays
- **Intelligent Caching**: Stable data (user info, teams) is cached for 24 hours to reduce API load
- **Cache Invalidation**: Cache is automatically cleared when authentication changes occur

**For Team Users:** Fetches both individual user data (for reset dates and limits) and team usage data (for actual usage counts and spending), then combines them for comprehensive insights. Caching ensures fast loading even when team APIs are slow.

**For Individual Users:** Uses your personal usage data directly from Cursor's individual user API, showing request counts and reset dates. The retry mechanism ensures reliable data fetching.

The extension gracefully falls back to cached data when APIs are unavailable, ensuring it works for all users regardless of their Cursor setup or network conditions.

**Visual Status Indicators:**

**When showing requests (remainingRequests > 0):**

- üü¢ **Normal**: Plenty of requests remaining (>10%)
- üü° **Warning**: Low on requests (‚â§10% remaining, yellow background)

**When showing spending (0 requests left):**

- üü¢ **Normal**: Spending well below limit (<80%)
- üü° **Warning**: Approaching spend limit (‚â•80%, yellow background)
- üî¥ **Critical**: Spend limit reached or exceeded (red background)

**Status Bar Display Logic:**

- `‚ö° 247` - 247 fast-premium requests remaining (normal state)
- `‚ö†Ô∏è 15` - Warning: low requests remaining (‚â§10%)
- `‚ö° $1.52/$150.00` - No requests left, normal spending (green)
- `‚ö†Ô∏è $120.50/$150.00` - No requests left, approaching limit (yellow)
- `‚ùå $150.00/$150.00` - No requests left, limit reached (red)

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Get Your Session Cookie

You'll need to extract your `WorkosCursorSessionToken` cookie from your browser:

1. Open [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) and log in
2. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
3. Navigate to **Application** ‚Üí **Cookies** ‚Üí `https://cursor.com`
4. Find `WorkosCursorSessionToken` and copy its value
5. In VS Code, run command: `Cursor Usage: Insert cookie value`
6. Paste the cookie value when prompted

### 2. Team ID (Optional)

**For Individual Users:** If you don't belong to any Cursor teams, you can skip this step entirely. The extension will automatically use your individual usage data.

**For Team Users:** If you belong to multiple Cursor teams, you may want to specify which team to track. You can set this via the `Cursor Usage: Set Team ID` command or in your settings.

- To auto-detect, leave the value empty or enter `auto`. The extension will use the first team it finds and cache the ID.
- To specify a team, find its `id` in the `teams` API request in your browser's network tab and enter it.

If you don't set a team ID, the extension will automatically try to use your first team, or fall back to individual data if no teams are found.

## Security & Privacy

Your security is paramount, so here's exactly what happens with your data:

### Why We Need Your Cookie

A fair question! Currently, Cursor's API only provides API tokens to users with "Admin" roles. This means that if you're a "Team Member," there's no official way to programmatically check your usage stats.

This extension bridges that gap by using the same session cookie your browser uses to talk to the Cursor dashboard. It's the only way to get you the usage data you need, right in your editor. We keep our fingers crossed that a more direct API will be available for everyone in the future!

### Cookie Storage

- Your session cookie is stored using VS Code's **SecretStorage API** ‚Äî the same secure mechanism used by official extensions
- The cookie never leaves your local machine except for direct API calls to Cursor
- It's encrypted and isolated from other extensions
- No logging or caching of sensitive data

Don't just take our word for it, though. This extension is fully open-source. Feel free to grab your magnifying glass, put on your detective hat, and inspect the code yourself :)

### Data Usage

- **We don't store anything**: Your cookie and usage data never reach us
- **Direct communication**: Extension talks directly to `cursor.com/api`
- **Minimal data**: Only fetches essential usage information
- **No tracking**: Zero analytics, telemetry, or data collection

### What Gets Sent

The extension only makes authenticated requests to these Cursor endpoints:

- `/api/auth/me` - to get your user information
- `/api/usage?user=USER_ID` - to get your individual usage data and reset dates
- `/api/dashboard/teams` - to get your team list
- `/api/dashboard/team` - to get your user ID within teams
- `/api/dashboard/get-team-spend` - to get team usage data

That's it. No third parties, no external services, no funny business.

## Installation

This extension is available on [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/yossisa/cursor-usage) (not VS Code Marketplace, since it's specifically for Cursor users).

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to Extensions panel
3. Search for "Cursor Usage"
4. Install and follow the setup steps above

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! For information on how to set up the development environment and run the test suite, please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Development Setup

This project uses Node.js v20. If you use `nvm`, you can run `nvm use` to automatically switch to the correct version.

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YossiSaadi/cursor-usage-vscode-extension.git
   cd cursor-usage-vscode-extension
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the watcher**

   ```bash
   yarn watch
   ```

4. **Launch the debugger**
   - Press `F5` in VS Code to open the **Extension Development Host**.
   - This will run the extension in a new VS Code window, where you can test its functionality.
   - Check the **Debug Console** in your original editor window for logs.

### Running Tests

The test suite can be run in two ways:

#### **Option 1: VS Code Debugger (Recommended for Development)**

For detailed information on how to set up the development environment and run the test suite, please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Quick Start:**

1. Set up your `.env` file with your Cursor session token (see Contributing Guide)
2. Open the **Run and Debug** panel in VS Code
3. Select **"Extension Tests"** from the dropdown
4. Press the green play button to start debugging

#### **Option 2: Command Line (For Automation/CI)**

```bash
# Compile and run tests from command line
yarn test

# Or compile first, then run
yarn compile
yarn test
```

**Environment Requirements:**

- Requires `.env` file with `WorkosCursorSessionToken`
- Uses your system's Cursor/VS Code installation (no download needed)
- Uses real API data for comprehensive testing
- Automatically detects and uses Cursor if available, falls back to VS Code

**Test Output Visibility:**

When running `yarn test`, the tests execute in a separate Cursor/VS Code instance:

- **Command line shows**: Basic progress, which editor is being used, and final exit code (0 = success)
- **Test details appear in**: The launched Cursor/VS Code instance's Debug Console
- **Design Rationale**: VS Code extension tests run in the actual editor environment to test real-world behavior

**To see detailed test results:**

1. **Look for the launched Cursor/VS Code window** that opens automatically
2. **Check the Debug Console** in that window (View ‚Üí Debug Console)
3. **For development debugging**: Use the VS Code debugger method (Option 1) for interactive debugging

**CI/CD Notes:**

- Tests run successfully in automated environments
- Uses existing Cursor/VS Code installation
- No additional downloads required
- Returns proper exit codes for CI pipeline integration (0 = success)

The test suite uses a "fetch-once, reuse-many" strategy with real API data for comprehensive testing.

### Building for Release

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
yarn compile

# Package for distribution
vsce package
```

## Troubleshooting

### Status bar shows "Set Cookie"

- Your session cookie isn't set or has expired.
- Re-run the `Cursor Usage: Insert cookie value` command.

### Status bar shows "Refresh Failed"

- There may be a network connectivity issue or the Cursor API is down.
- Your cookie might have expired; try re-inserting it.
- The extension will automatically retry failed requests up to 3 times.
- Run the `Cursor Usage: Force Re-initialize` command to clear cache and retry.

### Status bar shows old/stale data

- The extension caches data for 24 hours to reduce API load.
- Click the status bar item or run `Cursor Usage: Refresh Usage` to get fresh data.
- Run `Cursor Usage: Force Re-initialize` to clear all cached data.

### Spending information not showing

- **Individual users:** Spending data is only available for team users. Individual users will see request counts and reset dates only.
- **Team users:** Spending data (`spendCents` and `hardLimitOverrideDollars`) may not be available for all teams. Ensure your team has usage-based billing configured.
- The extension gracefully falls back to showing request counts when spending data is unavailable.

### Cache issues

- **Stale cache:** Use `Cursor Usage: Force Re-initialize` to clear all cached data.
- **Cache corruption:** The extension automatically detects and clears corrupted cache entries.
- **Storage quota:** If VS Code storage is full, cache operations may fail gracefully.

### Network connectivity issues

- **DNS errors:** Check your internet connection and DNS settings.
- **Connection timeouts:** The extension waits up to 10 seconds per API attempt.
- **Rate limiting:** The extension automatically handles rate limiting with retries.

### Authentication issues

- **Invalid cookie:** Re-insert your session cookie via `Cursor Usage: Insert cookie value`.
- **Expired session:** Your Cursor session may have expired; log in again and update the cookie.
- **Permission changes:** If you're a team user, ensure your team permissions haven't changed.

### Expected Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

During development and building, you may see these warnings which don't affect functionality:

- **"No license field"**: This is a yarn display issue - the package.json correctly has `"license": "MIT"`
- **"Engine vscode appears to be invalid"**: This is expected for VS Code extensions - the engine specification is correct

These warnings are cosmetic and don't impact the extension's operation.

### Note

Use `npm run lint:markdown` to make sure the markdown files are linted before committing.
