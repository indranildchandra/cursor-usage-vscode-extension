# Contributing to Cursor Usage

We welcome contributions! This guide will help you get your development environment set up and explain how to run the test suite.

## Development Setup

The development setup is straightforward. Please refer to the "Development Setup" section in the main [README.md](README.md) file for instructions on cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and launching the extension in a development host.

## Running Tests

Our test suite uses a "fetch-once, reuse-many" strategy. This means that the first time you run the tests, the suite will make live API calls to Cursor to fetch realistic data. It then caches this data and uses it for all subsequent test runs, making them fast and reliable.

### 1. Test Configuration (`.env` file)

To run the tests, you must provide your Cursor session token in a `.env` file at the root of the project.

#### **Step 1: Create the `.env` file**

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.

#### **Step 2: Add Your Credentials**

Add the following keys to your `.env` file and fill in the values:

```text
# Your session token from cursor.com
WorkosCursorSessionToken="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# (Optional) The specific team ID to test against.
# If left blank, the test will fall back to the teamId in your VS Code settings.
CursorTeamId="YOUR_TEAM_ID_HERE"
```

* **`WorkosCursorSessionToken`**: This is required. Follow the instructions in the main `README.md` to retrieve this value from your browser.
* **`CursorTeamId`**: This is optional. If you provide a value, the tests will use it. If you leave it blank, the tests will fall back to using the `teamId` configured in your VS Code settings, which is useful for testing the fallback logic.

### 2. Executing the Test Suite

The test suite can be run in two ways:

#### **Option 1: VS Code Debugger (Recommended for Development)**

1. Go to the **Run and Debug** panel in VS Code (you can click the icon on the left sidebar that looks like a play button with a bug).
2. In the dropdown at the top, select **"Extension Tests"**.
3. Press the green play button to start debugging.

This will perform the following steps:

* Compile all the extension and test files.
* Launch a new "Extension Development Host" window.
* Run the test suite.

You will see the results of the test run in the **Debug Console** of your main editor window.

#### **Option 2: Command Line (For Automation/CI)**

```bash
# Compile and run tests from command line
yarn test
```

This method is ideal for:

* Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines
* Automated testing workflows
* Running tests without opening VS Code or Cursor

The command-line runner will:

* Compile the extension and test files
* Use your system's Cursor/VS Code installation (no download needed)
* Execute the full test suite
* Return appropriate exit codes for CI systems
* Automatically detect and use Cursor if available, fall back to VS Code

**Test Output:**

* Command line shows: Basic progress, which editor is being used, and final exit code (0 = success)
* Test details appear in: The launched Cursor/VS Code instance's Debug Console
* Design Rationale: VS Code extension tests run in the actual editor environment to test real-world behavior

**To see detailed test results:**

1. **Look for the launched Cursor/VS Code window** that opens automatically
2. **Check the Debug Console** in that window (View â†’ Debug Console)
3. **For development debugging**: Use the VS Code debugger method instead

**CI/CD Notes:**

* Tests run successfully in automated environments
* Uses existing Cursor/VS Code installation
* No additional downloads required
* Returns proper exit codes for CI pipeline integration
* Compatible with most CI platforms (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
